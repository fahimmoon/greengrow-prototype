                <h3 class="faq-question">What makes your fertilizers organic?</h3>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Our organic fertilizers are made from natural sources such as compost, bone meal, fish emulsion, and other plant-based materials. They are certified by organic farming standards and contain no synthetic chemicals or artificial additives.</p>

                <h3 class="faq-question">How often should I apply fertilizer to my plants?</h3>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>The frequency depends on the type of fertilizer and plants. Generally, organic fertilizers are applied every 4-6 weeks during the growing season.

                <h3 class="faq-question">How quickly will I see results after applying fertilizer?</h3>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Results vary depending on the product and plant type. Liquid fertilizers typically show results within 1-2 weeks, while granular fertilizers may take 2-4 weeks.

                <h3 class="faq-question">Can I use organic and inorganic fertilizers together?</h3>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Yes, many gardeners use a combination of both. Organic fertilizers provide long-term soil health benefits, while inorganic fertilizers can provide quick nutrient boosts when needed. Just be careful not to over-fertilize.</p>
